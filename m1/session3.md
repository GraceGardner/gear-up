### Session 3 Structure

During Session 3, Mod 4 students will present their capstone presentations in small groups to your cohort.  The session should be set up as follows:

#### 1 week before presentations

- Mod 4 instructors will confirm which Mod 4 students will present to your cohort
- You will be asked to: 
  - Divide your students into small groups of 3-6 for each presenter 
  - Consider balancing identity and backgrounds across small groups if possible
- Share the assignments with Mod 4 instructors so they can confirm with Mod 4 presenters


#### Capstone Presentations (Suggested: Friday Week 5)

- Instructors of Mods 1, 2, 3 will lead the session 
- Lead Instructor will review the Gear Up Norms and Welcome the Mod 4 presenters to the group
  - You might want to have presenters do a quick intro
- Co-Instructor should make break out rooms while Lead Instructor opens the session
  - Each break out room should have a Mod 4 presenter and 3-6 students
- Lead Instructor will review the format for today

#### Capstone Format

- You will move into your break out rooms and do a quick round of introductions (Name, Pronouns, Where You Call Home) before the Mod 4 presenter begins
- Each Mod 4 presenter will share their screen and present their Gear Up Capstone which should be between 5-10 minutes
- After the presentation, you will have 15 minutes to discuss what you learned from your presenter and ask follow up questions
- You will complete the session by filling out this [Capstone Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/4rJQ8MspEHzF6wJD7)
