# Session Plan

## Gear Up Norms Review (10 min)
- Instructors should review the GU Norms 
- Give 5 minutes for reflection independently or in pairs on the GU Norms

      ## Gear Up Norms 

      *Adapted from Courageous Conversations*

      ### Stay Engaged

      - Be present in this space.
      - Close browsers, projects, or other distractions.
      - Stay with the topic.

      ### Speak Your Truth

      - Use “I” language for your experience, not generalizing the experience of many.
      - Everyone does not communicate the same way, appreciate the way people express their ideas.

      ### Accept The Experience

      - People sometimes try to “fix” the pain or discomfort of others, instead sit with them in the pain or discomfort.
      - We all experience things differently and our reality is different. Listen to that experience without judgment or attempts to minimize.

      ### Step Up, Step Back

      - Be mindful of the airtime you are taking. 
      - If you are often silent, push yourself to speak up. If you often speak, push yourself to listen more.

      ### Listen To Build

      - People are often waiting to share a point of view or experience and that can lead to missing the opportunity to connect to others. 
      - Listen to the ideas and try to BUILD on the conversation instead of dropping ideas in the middle of the circle. 

      ### Ongoing Work

      Equity and inclusion work does not end in an hour session. 
      These ideas are meant to be a starting point to an ongoing conversation and process. 
      There is not a clean, simple, or easy way to wrap up conversations on identity.

### Reflection on Norms
- Which of these norms is most challenging for you to focus on?
- Which of these norms will you focus on today? 


## Who is the Developer You Want to Be? (10 min)
- In the future, you will be a software developer with access to money, people, and power.  
Reflection individually or in pairs 
- What type of impact do you want to make in that space? 
  - Who will you be to your team? Your peers?
  - What will you be known for in your company?
  - What will you support with your time, resources, and money?

## Exploration (5 min)
- Instructors will provide two paths for exploration
  - Path 1: Students can go into break out rooms labeled with the topics
  - Path 2: Students can independently review the toipcs in the main room

- Select something you care about and consider what is the impact developers can have in these areas
  - Feel free to google for additional resources in these areas

- **Reflection questions**
  - Where are you most interested in making an impact in your future career?
  - What strengths do you bring into that work because of who you are and your experiences?
  - As a junior developer, your first role might not be aligned to your ultimate passion.  What are ways you could still work towards that goal?  What are the skills you need to make the impact you want?  How will you gain those skills if you don't already have them?
  - What are the ways you want to be rememebered in your work (the things you build? The way you work with others?)?
