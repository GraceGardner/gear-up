      ## Gear Up Norms 

      *Adapted from Courageous Conversations*

      ### Stay Engaged

      - Be present in this space.
      - Close browsers, projects, or other distractions.
      - Stay with the topic.

      ### Speak Your Truth

      - Use “I” language for your experience, not generalizing the experience of many.
      - Everyone does not communicate the same way, appreciate the way people express their ideas.

      ### Accept The Experience

      - People sometimes try to “fix” the pain or discomfort of others, instead sit with them in the pain or discomfort.
      - We all experience things differently and our reality is different. Listen to that experience without judgment or attempts to minimize.

      ### Step Up, Step Back

      - Be mindful of the airtime you are taking. 
      - If you are often silent, push yourself to speak up. If you often speak, push yourself to listen more.

      ### Listen To Build

      - People are often waiting to share a point of view or experience and that can lead to missing the opportunity to connect to others. 
      - Listen to the ideas and try to BUILD on the conversation instead of dropping ideas in the middle of the circle. 

      ### Ongoing Work

      Equity and inclusion work does not end in an hour session. 
      These ideas are meant to be a starting point to an ongoing conversation and process. 
      There is not a clean, simple, or easy way to wrap up conversations on identity.

#### REFLECTION 
- Which of these norms is most challenging for you to focus on?
- Which of these norms will you focus on today? 

## What is the Culture we are building?
- "Microaggressions come in three forms: microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations."
