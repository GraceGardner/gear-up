- Give 5 minutes for reflection independently or in pairs on the GU Norms

Capstone Overview (10 min)
- Instructors should review the Capstone details
- CFU for any questions on the content

Peer Feedback (10 min)
- Instructors should create pairs or threes (can be random) and break students into rooms to get initial feedback
- Peers will share their ideas and provide each other a positive and a push
  - What is one thing you connected to in their capstone ideas?
  - What is one area they could provide more information or more focus? 

Work Time (30 min)

  - Suggestion to provide break out rooms:
    - Whole group with instructor for questions
    - A "quiet" breakout room for accountability
    - 2-3 small group rooms recommended 3-4 people each
    - Independent rooms for all students
 - At the end of this time, students should submit XXXX
