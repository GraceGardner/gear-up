      ## Gear Up Norms 

      *Adapted from Courageous Conversations*

      ### Stay Engaged

      - Be present in this space.
      - Close browsers, projects, or other distractions.
      - Stay with the topic.

      ### Speak Your Truth

      - Use “I” language for your experience, not generalizing the experience of many.
      - Everyone does not communicate the same way, appreciate the way people express their ideas.

      ### Accept The Experience

      - People sometimes try to “fix” the pain or discomfort of others, instead sit with them in the pain or discomfort.
      - We all experience things differently and our reality is different. Listen to that experience without judgment or attempts to minimize.

      ### Step Up, Step Back

      - Be mindful of the airtime you are taking. 
      - If you are often silent, push yourself to speak up. If you often speak, push yourself to listen more.

      ### Listen To Build

      - People are often waiting to share a point of view or experience and that can lead to missing the opportunity to connect to others. 
      - Listen to the ideas and try to BUILD on the conversation instead of dropping ideas in the middle of the circle. 

      ### Ongoing Work

      Equity and inclusion work does not end in an hour session. 
      These ideas are meant to be a starting point to an ongoing conversation and process. 
      There is not a clean, simple, or easy way to wrap up conversations on identity.

#### REFLECTION 

  - Which of these norms is most challenging for you right now?
  - Which of these norms will be most important when you are practicing your presentation today?  
  - Which of these norms will be most important when you are giving feedback on other's presentations today?

## Capstone Overview (10 min)

#### In Mod 4, each student will put together their experiences in Gear Up and present a Gear Up Capstone.  Those capstones will be presented in small groups of Mod 1, 2, and 3 students in week 5.  

- Each Mod 4 student will join a cohort and will be assigned a break out room with 4-5 students
- This will provide time for more individual connections, introductions, and follow up questions

#### Capstones should include the following:

- A reflection on who you are and why that will make you a great software developer
- An area that you want to focus on connected to diversity and inclusion in your future career
- Any additional elements that capture your experience


#### Capstones should be between 5-10 minutes and should include a visual format (slides, video, etc) to share the content.  We encourage you to be creative and represent yourself in this format.  After you present, you will have time to discuss with the small group you are assigned.
 
##### If you have an idea that better represents your synthesis of Gear Up, pitch the idea to your Mod 4 instructor.  


## Practice Presentations (40 - 50 min)

You will move into your break out rooms for the next 40 minutes.  You should complete the following:

    - Was the communication effective?
    - What is one way the presentation could be improved?
