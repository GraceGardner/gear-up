# Mod 4: Session 3

## Purpose:  Communicate the impact you will have to a small group of Turing Students

### Session 3 Structure

During Session 3, students will present their capstone presentations in small groups.  The session can be set up as follows:

#### 1 week before presentations

- Assign Mod 4 students to Module 1, 2, or 3 cohorts 
  - Assign BE with BE and FE with FE cohorts
  - Consider balancing identities and backgrounds across cohorts if possible
  - Assign the number of presenters based on the number of students in the cohort 
    - There should be enough presentors for at minimum 3 students and maximum 6 students in each small group
    - If necessary, you can assign cross program in order to balance the small groups
- Confirm assignments with the Mod 1, 2, 3 instructors
  - Ask instructors to divide their students into small groups of 3-6 for each presenter 
  - Ask instructors to consider balancing identity and backgrounds across small groups if possible
- Share the assignments with the Mod 4 students so they know which module they will present to and identify any conflicts


#### Capstone Presentations (Suggested: Friday Week 5)

- Instructors of Mods 1, 2, 3 will lead the session 
- Lead Instructor will review the Gear Up Norms and Welcome the Mod 4 presenters to the group
  - You might want to have presenters do a quick intro
- Co-Instructor should make break out rooms while Lead Instructor opens the session
  - Each break out room should have a Mod 4 presenter and 3-6 students
- Lead Instructor will review the format for today

#### Capstone Format

- You will move into your break out rooms and do a quick round of introductions (Name, Pronouns, Where You Call Home) before the Mod 4 presenter begins
- Each Mod 4 presenter will share their screen and present their Gear Up Capstone which should be between 5-10 minutes
- After the presentation, you will have 15 minutes to discuss what you learned from your presenter and ask follow up questions
- You will complete the session by filling out this [Capstone Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/4rJQ8MspEHzF6wJD7)
- You do not need to return to the main room at the end of the session
