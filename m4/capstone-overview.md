## Gear Up Capstone 


Each student will present a Gear Up Capstone that is a synthesis of your overall experience


#### In Mod 4, each student will put together their experiences in Gear Up and present a Gear Up Capstone.  Those capstones will be presented in small groups of Mod 1, 2, and 3 students in week 5.  

- Each Mod 4 student will join a cohort and will be assigned a break out room with 4-5 students
- This will provide time for more individual connections, introductions, and follow up questions

#### Capstones should include the following:

- A reflection on who you are and why that will make you a great software developer
- An area that you want to focus on connected to diversity and inclusion in your future career
- Any additional elements that capture your experience


#### Capstones should be between 5-10 minutes and should include a visual format (slides, video, etc) to share the content.  We encourage you to be creative and represent yourself in this format.  After you present, you will have time to discuss with the small group you are assigned.
 
##### If you have an idea that better represents your synthesis of Gear Up, pitch the idea to your Mod 4 instructor.
