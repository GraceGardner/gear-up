## Gear Up Norms

*Adapted from Courageous Conversations*

### Stay Engaged

- Be present in this space.
- Close browsers, projects, or other distractions.
- Stay with the topic.

### Speak Your Truth

- Use “I” language for your experience, not generalizing the experience of many.
- Everyone does not communicate the same way, appreciate the way people express their ideas.

### Accept The Experience

- People sometimes try to “fix” the pain or discomfort of others, instead sit with them in the pain or discomfort.
- We all experience things differently and our reality is different. Listen to that experience without judgment or attempts to minimize.

### Step Up, Step Back

- Be mindful of the airtime you are taking. 
- If you are often silent, push yourself to speak up. If you often speak, push yourself to listen more.

### Listen To Build

- People are often waiting to share a point of view or experience and that can lead to missing the opportunity to connect to others. 
- Listen to the ideas and try to BUILD on the conversation instead of dropping ideas in the middle of the circle. 

### Ongoing Work

Equity and inclusion work does not end in an hour session. 
These ideas are meant to be a starting point to an ongoing conversation and process. 
There is not a clean, simple, or easy way to wrap up conversations on identity.


## Session Design

Sessions in Modules 1 - 3 will follow a general format that includes:

- Content is provided for review at least 48 hours prior to the session on Turing.io/GearUp (TBD)
- Each session will have the option of independent reflection or group discussions
- Each student will submit a synthesis of what they are learning and applying from the session in a google form.
- Students in the independent reflection can link their gist or write a summary response
- Students in discussion groups will share what they learned from their discussion group
- *FE/BE cohorts will be combined to have two facilitators in each session*
