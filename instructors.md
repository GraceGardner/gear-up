# GU2021 Changes

In conversations of diversity and inclusion, people who are in the non-dominant group are often put in more vulnerable situations than others. We cannot force all students to be ready for conversations and we do not allow students to “opt out.” If we have differentiated ways to engage, we set up better conditions for meaningful engagement.  

Sometimes students are not in the right space to be in a discussion group regardless of identity or background.  People have bad days and life situations that create stress.  Options for engagement can help meet people where they are and not force them into a specific space that could be more harmful for them or those around them. 

The purpose of Gear Up is to provide a foundation for reflections on intersectionality and identity.  We hope that students develop greater empathy and awareness of others’ experiences and that they can build the skills to address micro and macro aggressions they see.  Gear Up will culminate in a Mod 4 presentation where students will share how their identity brings a unique perspective to who they are as a developer.  

If you are not comfortable teaching a session, please discuss that with your module team and your Director.  We do not want anyone teaching content they do not feel that they could successfully facilitate. 


## Session Design

Sessions in Modules 1 - 3 will follow a general format that includes:

- Content is provided for review at least 48 hours prior to the session on Turing.io/GearUp
- Each session will have the option of independent reflection or group discussions
- Each student will submit a synthesis of what they are learning and applying from the session in a google form.
    - Students in the independent reflection can link their gist or write a summary response
    - Students in discussion groups will share what they learned from their discussion group
- *FE/BE cohorts will be combined to have two facilitators in each session* 
   - Instructors could chose to faciliate individually, however it is recommended to have two perspectives in each session

## Instructor Role

Instructors will facilitate groups during the Gear Up sessions.  This will include:


- Setting up Zoom rooms with breakout options that include:
    - Individual reflection space (main room)
    - 2-3 discussion rooms with specific discussion questions 
        - Discussion rooms might have the same set of questions to encourage groups of no more than 4-5 in each room
- Instructors will begin the session by reviewing the outcomes and providing time for people to engage in the content that is laid out in the session plan
- Instructors will set norms for the discussions with the full cohort before going into breakout spaces
- Within each discussion group there will be 3 roles
    - **Facilitator** -- Ensuring voices are heard, talk time is distributed, prompting questions
    - **Timer** -- Reminds the group when 5 min are left so they can start to synthesis discussion learnings
    - **Safety Valve** -- Person who will message the instructor if the discussion becomes disrespectful or if the group is struggling 
- Attendance will be taken once students select their rooms
- For individuals who choose individual reflection, their submissions will be due by the end of the Gear Up session.  Those reflections will be reviewed by instructors.
- If there are concerns about a reflection, please discuss with your Director
