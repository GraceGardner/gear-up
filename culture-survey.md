# Cohort Culture Survey

## Overview

Once a module, each cohort should complete a cohort culture survey. Recommending this to happen after the cohort has had time to connect with each other and before week 3.

The purpose of the culture survey is to encourage a positive and inclusive cohort culture, open up lines of communication, and provide and opportunity for a culture reset.

## Survey Questions

All questions are on a 5 point scale of Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree and you can modify questions and/or the scale as needed.

- My input and ideas are always heard and considered in group settings
- When given time to discuss, I have always been given the space to answer a question posed to a group
- My perspective is regularly considered and/or incorporated in group work
- I've never been interrupted or spoken over when expressing my thoughts
- My cohortmates' interactions with me always reflect positive intent
- I feel members of my project group or breakout groups are working to be inclusive of all members
- I have never felt that my technical ability kept my input from being considered in a pair or group setting
- No one in my cohort has ever questioned my ability to complete a technical task
- No one in my cohort has ever questioned my ability to become a software developer
- Is there any event or situation you would like to share for your cohort to see how inclusion is working well? 
- Is there any event or situation you would like to share for your cohort to see how inclusion is not working? 

## Recommended Execution 

- Copy the [Cohort Culture Survey](https://forms.gle/tpc7ckuss5tiq5RbA) into your own drive or to your cohort's file on google drive. 
- Send out the survey link with this message (or customize to your own words!)

  - "In order to create an inclusive space, we need to constantly be reviewing our actions and making adjustments to our norms.  It is easy to set a norm, but living up to it takes more intention.  We ask that you take 5 minutes to complete this survey by Thursday morning at 9:00 am.  Please consider your experience during this module when you are answering these questions.  We will then review the results as a cohort and adjust norms as needed."

- Set aside at least 30 minutes with your cohort team to review the results before you will discuss it with the cohort. 
  - After reviewing the results, determine your discussion approach
  - If anything is extremely concerning, set up time with Emma or your Director to discuss an approach.


## Discussion Options

### Option 1: Renorming conversation with SLC reps 
- Set up a meeting with your SLC Reps to discuss a renorming conversation with the cohort,  This could look like:
- Reviewing the results and determining 1-2 areas of strength and 1-2 areas of focus
- Create discussion questions with your SLC Reps and determine if they want to be a part of leading/supporting any discussions
- Set up a 45 minute conversation with your cohort
  - Start with a focus on what is working and have your cohort identify specific actions they are taking to create a supportive environment
  - Move into areas for growth and improvement
    - If possible, focus on 1-2 areas that the cohort could improve
    - Begin by sharing ways the instructional team can reinforce and support positive behaviors or call out when actions are counterproductive
    - Open the conversation to the cohort to focus on specific behaviors that would help create a more inclusive environment
- Reset cohort norms as needed
	

### Option 2: Independent Reflection
- Share the results with your cohort ask them to each reflect on the results
  - Create reflection questions focused on strengths and areas of growth such as:
    - What is one action from others that makes you feel included in the cohort?
    - What is one action that you do to make others feel included?
    - What is one action or experience you have had that makes you feel excluded?
    - What is one action or experience you have commited that could make others feel excluded?
  - Set up a specific time for everyone to review the results and complete their reflections
  - Have students submit reflections through a chat, google form, or slack thread
- Review student responses, summarize, and share back with the cohort
- Reset cohort norms or work with SAB to use retro to reset norms

### Option 3:  Custom plan
Create a custom plan based on your cohort results -- ensure you have some way to share the results and identify behaviors that are working and reset norms as needed
