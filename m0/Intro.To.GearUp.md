## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google.
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge.
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video? Everyone has biases. We aren't always aware of them, but the important thing is acknowledging that they are there. Our biases can keep us from giving people chances based on appearances. By acknowledging that we have biases, we can open ourselves up to possibilities that we wouldn't have had available before. If everyone were to be aware of their biases, our society could be much more equal.
* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing? I personally never thought of them until a friend of mine who is mixed race pointed them out to me and told me that I actually was dismissive of his experience as a black man in America. It really made me step back and re-evaluate my education on the struggles that black Americans struggle with. As someone who was homeschooled by white parents who are very openly racist against many races, I never wanted to be like them... but I hadn't realized how little I knew about the cultures that they openly criticized. After my friend, Don, confronted me I spent as much of my free time as I could doing research about Black history and current events in the black community. I was shocked to see how much I didn't know. I think that many of us don't even realize that our biases exist, which is why it's important for us all to point them out when we see them. If I didn't have such a strong friend who came to me to be honest about how I made him feel, I would have never been able to grow the way I have.
* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products? One reason that the front end program spoke to me so much is that we will be working to make things user friendly. That means for everyone who might come in contact with our software. It's going to be very important to think outside of our conceptions of humanity and really think about people who are under represented. Finding ways to make everything we build usable for people of all walks of life is so important.


#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis? Over the years I have worked in many environments that were mostly male dominated. Even at Starbucks, I was passed over by men who were not as qualified because they were more likable. It has been difficult for me, as a woman, to find strength to continue moving forward in different career paths due to sexism. I left my post as an operations manager of a medical engraving company due to sexism. It has taken me years to recover from the experience. I believe that sharing my personal experiences with other women and listening to the experiences that they have had can help us grow together towards a more inclusive future.
 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing? I am aware that I have many privileges as a white woman. It's important to me that all women are given equal chances based on their skill levels. Empowering other women is very important to me.
 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you? Over the years I have become much more empowered to speak up when I hear or see others treating individuals poorly due to their appearance or sexual identity. Being someone who is willing to encourage and accept others is very important to me. I believe that we all need someone who believes in us and encourages us to grow into the person we want to be. If I can be that person for every one individual in my lifetime, I will be grateful.
 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort? I hope to empower others of all backgrounds throughout Turing. Hopefully through hard work and dedication, anyone who has biases about women in tech might change them. I also would hope to be a safe space for those who are struggling personally or with the work load throughout turing.
